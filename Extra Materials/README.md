# Meow Around and Find Out

@annwon603 and @ohasis created this virtual reality world while part of the second **Mixed Augmented Virtual Extended Reality Innovation Center (MAVERiC)** cohort at UCSD.

Our cohort met twice a week for ten weeks for a total of forty hours during winter quarter of 2024. Under the guidance of Joseph Unger and  of Origami Air Studios, our twenty-person
cohort learned about the Unity to VR Chat design pipeline.

This repository includes all relevant packages and scripts used to build our world in Unity. That being said, multiple assets and materials were modeled and imported from the
platforms Maya, Blender, and Canva.



It reflects the knowledge gleaned from the data we gathered, all related to designing a solution to the growing food waste problem in the United States.
With the survey we designed to facilitate data collection, we examined the following behaviors:

* Grocery Shopping Habits
* Managing Groceries at Home
* Monitoring Expiration Dates

### World Description

With our fast-paced society becoming increasingly dominated by the busyness of consumerism, our markets are becoming more and more crowded.
As such, we often end up with food in our refrigerators that we either do not need or can no longer eat.
The United States is a notorious contributor to the problem of food waste, especially when considering the ever-increasing portion sizes of the American diet.
We want to tackle this problem head-on and target the problem at home, given that learning and teaching healthy food management habits early on will encourage long-term retention.

In specific terms, this would translate to fewer food items, especially produce, being forgotten and thrown away or being deemed “unusable” because individuals do not know how to incorporate them into their meal plans.
